# 🌐 Bond – Disaster Response & Family Reconnection App

**Bond** is an offline-first, AI-powered mobile application built during my first hackathon — designed to help users **stay connected, stay safe, and stay informed** during disasters. When the internet fails, Bond doesn’t.

## 🚨 Key Features

### 🔗 Offline Communication via BLE Mesh
- Uses **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to form a **mesh network**.
- Enables **offline messaging and location sharing** between nearby users.
- Includes an **SOS Button** to instantly broadcast the user’s location for rescue — even without internet.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Risk Detection
- Integrates with **weather APIs** to analyze:
  - 🌡️ Temperature
  - 💧 Humidity
  - 🌬️ Wind speed
- Every hour, the AI classifies users as **Safe / Moderate / In Danger**.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Circle Monitoring
- Users can create a **Circle** (family or trusted contacts).
- Monitors vital signs (heartbeat, steps) from connected smartwatches or fitness apps.
- Shows live **location**, **safety status**, and **SOS alerts** within the circle.

### 🗺️ Smart Emergency Map
- Displays **offline maps** of local areas.
- Shows **nearby evacuation points** like police stations, fire departments, and barangay halls.
- Dynamically **suggests the nearest help centers** based on the user’s geolocation.

## 🧠 Why Bond?

> “When all connections fail — Bond doesn’t.”

Bond was created to solve a real problem in the Philippines: **disasters often knock out communication**, putting lives at risk. This app bridges that gap using local device-to-device communication and intelligent AI insights.
